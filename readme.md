# General Purpose Modifiable AST Parser

## Introduction

This project is part of a bachelor's thesis at the Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf.
Goal of this project is to implement a tool, which does generate an abstract syntax tree based on a given
language grammar. This abstract syntax tree can be modified by the user, and then compiled back to source code.
This can be used for automated refactorings, which cannot be done by search&replace or common IDE features.
